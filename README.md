x3pr Basic read/write utilities for the x3p surface metrology format in R. The package is not up on CRAN yet. 
The best way to install x3pr is with Hadley Wickham's devtools: https://github.com/hadley/devtools 
and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html. First install devtools in your R distribution 
(devtools is up on CRAN now so install.packages("devtools") should suffice). Next execute install_github("x3pr").
